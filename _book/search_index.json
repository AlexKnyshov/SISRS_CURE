For example, here is a simply phylogeny of some groups of vertebrates: To gain some understanding of phylogenies and phylogenetics check out 1. A brief description of phylogenetics. 2.

Phylogenies as a tool "],["research.html", "Chapter 3 Research", " Chapter 3 Research Now that you have a sense of why phylogenies are so important you can start to think about a group whose evolutionary history you might like to investigate. You can pick any group or ask your instructor for suggestions. Once you pick a group you’ll need to investigate it a bit more to determine whether you can narrow your research to address particularly interesting research questions, and then determine whether there are data to help you answer those questions. You might consider picking a group that is studied by URI faculty. If you still need ideas click here. To get started find out something about your group. You can start with Google, although you should rapidly move on to searching the primary literature.

We’ll be using genome sequence data to determine the species relationships in your group. Learn more about how molecular data is used in phylogenetics. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21122/ To acquire molecular data to compare the species in your group you either need to do a lot of sequencing, or find sequencing someone else has done. Becuase sequencing takes time and money we’ll try using data that is already available and just hasn’t bee analyzed to answer the questions you are interested in. Go to the European Nucleotide Archive Select: Data type: Raw Reads Query: pick taxonomy (include subordinate) Add to query box: AND instrument_platform=“ILLUMINA” AND (library_strategy=“RNA-Seq” OR library_strategy=“WGS”) Fields: base_count, fastq_bytes, fastq_ftp, read_count, scientific_name, tax_id Click Download report tsv You can open this file in Excel or similar It might look like you have a lot of data, but it’s actually hard to tell from this page. You might have a lot of data for one or a few species and not enough to analyze your whole group. You could count up how much data you have by hand, but that would take a lot of time if you have a lot of samples. Instead, let’s learn how to run small computer programs that can do this analysis for you very quickly. "],["getting-the-computer-to-run-analyses.html", "Chapter 5 Getting the computer to run analyses", " Chapter 5 Getting the computer to run analyses Rather than counting how much data we have by hand, let’s get the computer to do this tedious work for us.

"],["computational-skills.html", "Chapter 6 Computational skills 6.1 Log in to the server 6.2 Basic navigation", " Chapter 6 Computational skills We have seen a little bit of how the computer can analyze data much more quckly than we can do by hand. This is even more true when we have genome data. For example, the human genome is 3.2 billion bases. It would be hard to compare all that data to data from other species just using your eyes. Instead we’re going to need to learn some basic programming skills so we can tell the computer how to work with our data. First, you’ll have noticed that the computer we’re using doesn’t have the graphical interface you usually use (like a PC or Mac). That means you have to type in your commands - you can’t point and click. This actually has a hidden benefit because it’s easy to write down what you did in a line of text rather than having to try to explain where to click on each step. Let’s start by learning how to log in the our server and run commands without clicking. If you have a PC you’ll need git-bash.

Start by writing down everything you said for your presentation. Try noting different subsections. You might have to read more to completely elaborate on what you want to communicate. A professional scientific paper is approximately 4000-8000 words. However, your work, being focused on the phylogeny and perhaps not including any further discussion of evolution, is likely appropriate for a note in the jounal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

There are so many species out there. It is hard to know what might be interesting. To get you started here are some examples of past research questions: Did disease-carrying ticks evolve so that closely related species carry the same parasite? Or do distantly related species have a single species of parasite that they carry? Did birds evolve to live on water once or more times? Do plants in South America that look similar share a common ancestor, or did that phenotype evolve more than once to adapt to the environment? Here are some groups that are studied at URI that you might find interesting: Hard coral (Scleractinia). Consider how Astrangia poculata might have evolved to live in the cold waters of New England (in doing background research look up the whole family). Adelgids. How did these species (hemipteran parasites on trees such as hemlock) parasitize species of trees? Sharks "]]
