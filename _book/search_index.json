"],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Phylogenies", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Phylogenies If you’re familiar with the basics of evolution you’re probably familiar with phylogenies: the tree-like structure that allows you to tell how closely related species are. For example, here is a simply phylogeny of some groups of vertebrates: To gain some understanding of phylogenies and phylogenetics check out 1. A brief description of phylogenetics. 2.

Phylogenies as a tool "],["research.html", "Chapter 3 Research 3.1 Freewrite assignment 3.2 Annotated Bibliography assignment", " Chapter 3 Research Now that you have a sense of why phylogenies are so important you can start to think about a group whose evolutionary history you might like to investigate. You can pick any group or ask your instructor for suggestions. Once you pick a group you’ll need to investigate it a bit more to determine whether you can narrow your research to address particularly interesting research questions, and then determine whether there are data to help you answer those questions. You might consider picking a group that is studied by URI faculty. If you still need ideas click here. To get started find out something about your group. You can start with Google, although you should rapidly move on to searching the primary literature. How to use Google Scholar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7bUS9TYvRU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vSE-_iq7NE When you find an article you want, you can access it as a member of the URI community. However, if you are off campus the journal may not recognize you. In Google Scholar click the menu bar in the upper left and choose settings. Search for the University of Rhode Island and select URI library. Google Scholar will now have Search @ URI Libraries on the right if there’s an article you want. You may need to search for you article via the library website. Go to https://web.uri.edu/library/. Under Find Resources paste the name of an article of interest and Search. Find the online resource that allows you to have access and sign in with your URI login. If URI has access to the article you should be able to read it. You may need to repeat your search on the URI website for other articles depending on your connection. Once you locate a paper to read you need to read it. Check out these recommendations on how to read a paper efficiently and effectively: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv5ku0eoY6k https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaD0ZaUJ3Y At this point you may have picked a group to study, and hopefully you have a good reason for this group. Keep in mind that you may be fascinated by a particular group of species, but you still have to convince others to be equally fascinated. If you aren’t sure, try explaining your project to a friend or roommate. Also check out past projects for example research questions. At this point you should have a group of species and a (possibly vague) question. You won’t have everything pinned down precisely, but write down what you have. Now let’s research your group a bit more. First, find out more about your group, particularly the number of species and its age, by looking at Wikipedia and searching Google. If you picked a group that has a lot of species (e.g. birds, mammals), see if you can pick a smaller clade within your group of interest. You can also find out more about the species in your group by searching the Open Tree of Life and TimeTree. 3.1 Freewrite assignment At this point you should have a lot of ideas in your head. Now is the time to write them down. When scientists plan their research project they typically do a lot of writing. In this end this kind of writing turns into a formal research proposal, but the process of shaping that proposal usually starts with lots of notes about (1) what the researcher thinks the question is at the beginning, and (2) what is known in the field from reading a lot of papers. You are going to work through this process now to make a plan for your own research. First, write 1-2 pages of what you think your question is, why it’s interesting, and what is known in the field. If writing makes you think your question has already been answered, or needs more work before you can answer it, write all that down. You have two options here, first to truly freewrite your thoughts and see how they evolve and change, and second to go back and change your question if you discover it needs refinement. Either way, don’t get bogged down in details or grammar - try to get your ideas and background onto the paper. You should use this assignment to seek your plan and question yourself as to whether it will be successful. Think about this piece of work like an artist’s sketchbook that requires multiple tries to produce something that seems good. We will use this writing for discussion in class where you will have a chance to get comments so that you can have the best research plan moving forward. A successful freewrite will make you feel like you have a question and plan that will stand up to skeptical questioning by your peers. 3.2 Annotated Bibliography assignment Once you really know what you want to work on, you should make sure you understand the background to your research. That means reading the primary literature in more depth. An annotated bibliography can help you organize your understanding of this material. Develop an annotated bibliography of at least 5 sources. Note that you may need to skim 10-20 papers before settling on 5 to read in depth. See suggestions above for how to read papers. Your annotated bibliography should include the full citation followed by a 1-2 paragraph summary of the important points (particularly results) in the article as they relate to your research. Note that an annotated bibliography is not an abstract. Here are some examples and references: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/annotated_bibliography_samples.html https://guides.library.cornell.edu/annotatedbibliography "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods", " Chapter 4 Methods Once you have settled on a group that you are interested in studying you need to find out if there are data to help you answer your research questions. We’ll be using genome sequence data to determine the species relationships in your group. Read the following to learn more about molecular phylogenetics:’ Learn more about how molecular data is used in phylogenetics. Genomes ch. 16 To acquire molecular data to compare the species in your group you either need to do a lot of sequencing, or find sequencing someone else has done. Becuase sequencing takes time and money we’ll try using data that is already available and just hasn’t been analyzed to answer the questions you are interested in. Go to the European Nucleotide Archive Select: Data type: Raw Reads Query: pick taxonomy (include subordinate) Add to query box: AND instrument_platform=“ILLUMINA” AND (library_strategy=“RNA-Seq” OR library_strategy=“WGS”) Fields: base_count, fastq_bytes, fastq_ftp, read_count, scientific_name, tax_id Click Download report tsv You can open this file in Excel or similar It might look like you have a lot of data, but it’s actually hard to tell from this page. You might have a lot of data for one or a few species and not enough to analyze your whole group. You could count up how much data you have by hand, but that would take a lot of time if you have a lot of samples. Instead, let’s learn how to run small computer programs that can do this analysis for you very quickly. "],["getting-the-computer-to-run-analyses.html", "Chapter 5 Getting the computer to run analyses", " Chapter 5 Getting the computer to run analyses Rather than counting how much data we have by hand, let’s get the computer to do this tedious work for us. To get started Log in to the RStudio Server on campus. Enter your username (the first part of your email address) and password (URI student ID) Make a new project to work on this research project Use the Upload button (lower right) to upload the file of information you obtained from ENA Click the Terminal tab and type Rscript ../../shared/make_download_script.R [file] [target_data_size] [outfile] Replace the items in brackets with: your file from ENA target data size should be in Mbp - get genome size, multiply by coverage, and round up significantly a name you determine to save information to Now click on the output files to fine out what species have enough data to work with. If you are satisfied with the available data continue. Otherwise you might need to try a different group. "],["computational-skills.html", "Chapter 6 Computational skills 6.1 Log in to the server 6.2 Basic navigation", " Chapter 6 Computational skills We have seen a little bit of how the computer can analyze data much more quckly than we can do by hand. This is even more true when we have genome data. For example, the human genome is 3.2 billion bases. It would be hard to compare all that data to data from other species just using your eyes. Instead we’re going to need to learn some basic programming skills so we can tell the computer how to work with our data. First, you’ll have noticed that the computer we’re using doesn’t have the graphical interface you usually use (like a PC or Mac). That means you have to type in your commands - you can’t point and click. This actually has a hidden benefit because it’s easy to write down what you did in a line of text rather than having to try to explain where to click on each step. Let’s start by learning how to log in the our server and run commands without clicking. 6.1 Log in to the server Mac: open your Terminal (you may need to search for it) at the prompt type ssh -l username bluewaves.uri.edu , replacing username with the first part of your email address. you should be prompted to enter a password of your choice - note that the password does not show up when you type you should arrive at a prompt for bluewaves PC: Download and install git-bash. open git-bash at the prompt type ssh -l username bluewaves.uri.edu , replacing username with the first part of your email address. you should be prompted to enter a password of your choice - note that the password does not show up when you type you should arrive at a prompt for bluewaves 6.2 Basic navigation You are now logged in to bluewaves, which is a cluster of computers that can be used for research. First, you’ll need to learn to navigate around only by typing. Computing clusters typically require you to type all the commands. For example, to list all the files in your home folder (where you are when you log in) type ls. There probably isn’t anything in this folder right now. This is just like opening a folder in a Finder window on a Mac or a folder on a PC, except you had to type the command instead of simply double clicking. Second (and to help you get used to typing instead of clicking), let’s find out where we are in the folder structure. You should be in your home folder, which is inside another folder, and so on and so forth. Think of it as a highly organized filing cabinet, and you will need to move in between folders to access files. Type pwd to see the folder you are in. You’ll see your folder at the end, preceeded by a slash, preceeded by another folder, and so on. Let’s start by making a new folder to put your work in. Use the mkdir command to make a new directory. Unlike the prior commands you learned, but like most commands you’ll use, this command also takes an argument, which is another “word” that comes after this command. When you make a directory you need to name it, so instead of just mkdir you need mkdir results or mkdir test or some other folder name. Now that you have a new folder open it up. You change the directory using the cd command. Again, this command takes an argument so you’ll type cd results or cd test depending on what you named your folder. Type pwd again. Notice what folder you are in. To go back to the folder containing your current folder type cd .., which will take you one level up in the folder hierarchy. Type pwd again to see where you are now.

A professional scientific paper is approximately 4000-8000 words. However, your work, being focused on the phylogeny and perhaps not including any further discussion of evolution, is likely appropriate for a note in the jounal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

There are so many species out there. It is hard to know what might be interesting. To get you started here are some examples of past research questions: Did disease-carrying ticks evolve so that closely related species carry the same parasite? Or do distantly related species have a single species of parasite that they carry? Did birds evolve to live on water once or more times? Do plants in South America that look similar share a common ancestor, or did that phenotype evolve more than once to adapt to the environment? Here are some groups that are studied at URI that you might find interesting: Hard coral (Scleractinia). Consider how Astrangia poculata might have evolved to live in the cold waters of New England (in doing background research look up the whole family). Adelgids. How did these species (hemipteran parasites on trees such as hemlock) parasitize species of trees? Sharks "]]
