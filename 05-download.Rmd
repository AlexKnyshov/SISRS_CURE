# Getting your data

## Download
Include an outgroup

Move into your data folder with `cd`.

Our next step will be to download the data you want to work with onto Bluewaves.
First we need to create a **script** to make this happen.
A script is a detailed set of instructions for the computer to follow.
Your script is going to be a series of instructions to download files and put them in particular folders so you can access them.
We are going to use the program `nano`, which is built into Bluewaves to write this script.
Type `nano download_data.sh`.
Again, we have a command followed by an argument (in this case the name of the file we are creating).
Notice how the file ends in `.sh`.
Just like you have files that end in `.xls` or `.doc` this tells the computer the file is a shell script.

Commands in your shell script and just like commands on the command line.
For each file you want to download type the following on a single line:

* `wget`
* The ftp link
* `-P`
* the scientific name (as one word without spaces)

Repeat with the second ftp link for the sample if it has one.

Exit `nano` using `ctrl-x` and save your changes.

To download data to Bluewaves we need to access a special part of the system.
First let's make sure your script will run even if you close your computer and disconnect from Bluewaves.
Without this step when you disconnect your commands will stop running.

`screen`

Now move to the download node on Bluewaves with `ssh fs03`.

Finally, run your scrip with `bash download_data.sh`.

To go back to your main terminal type `ctrl-ad`. In the future to get back into the screen window type `screen -r`.
Once all your data download you will see your main prompt again.
Type `exit` to quite the screen.
