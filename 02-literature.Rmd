# Research

Now that you have a sense of why phylogenies are so important
you can start to think about a group whose evolutionary history you might like to investigate.
You can pick any group or ask your instructor for suggestions.
Once you pick a group you'll need to investigate it a bit more to determine
whether you can narrow your research to address particularly interesting research questions,
and then determine whether there are data to help you answer those questions.
You might consider picking a group that is studied by URI faculty.

To get started find out something about your group.
You can start with Google, although you should rapidly move on to searching the primary literature.

Once you locate a paper to read you need to read it.

You will need to turn in an annotated bibliography of at least 5 sources.
Note that you may need to skim 10-20 papers before settling on 5 to read in depth.
Your annotated bibliography should include the full citation followed by a 1-2 paragraph summary of the important points (particularly results) in the article as they relate to your research.
Note that an annotated bibliography is not an abstract.
