## Phylogenies

If you're familiar with the basics of evolution you're probably familiar with phylogenies:
the tree-like structure that allows you to tell how closely related species are.
For example, here is a simply phylogeny of some groups of vertebrates:

Now watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaw7nF72Aw) to understand the motivation behind phylogenetic research and the role you can play in determining how evolution happened.
